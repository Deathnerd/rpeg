================================================
<event> -> Used to group related dialogs (will scope), so a dialog from
           EventA will not be able to refer to a dialog from EventB

           name: identifier of the event (will show up as title in game)
           type: defines what type of room the event will show up in
                 currently (event, entrance, exit, alter, item and shop)
           level: defines what floor type this event will should up (dungeon,
                  lava, hell, etc...) can use special word 'any' to allow in
                  any floor type

<tag> -> Used inside <event>. Will replace special identifiers in templates
         such as "[word]" where 'word' is the identifier to be replaced. Usage
         indentifier@replacement. Ex. object@sword with replace [object] with
         sword. Also useful in general to tag what the event is all about.
